        I am a highly skilled front-end developer with expertise in full stack development using the
        MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS) and a passion for UX/UI design. I have
        completed a Full Stack Developer Bootcamp with Ironhack, which has given me a solid
        understanding of web development best practices and the ability to create dynamic and
        responsive user interfaces. My proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows me to write
        clean, efficient code that meets the latest web standards. I am well-versed in the latest
        web development technologies and have a solid understanding of the entire web development
        process, from design to deployment. I am a team player and have excellent problem-solving
        and communication skills, and I am always eager to learn and stay current with the latest
        industry trends and developments.
